# Baby Printer
Race to deliver as many babies on time as possible and get a good stork rating!
Good luck! It's tough out there as a baby delivering stork!

## Embedded Player
I'm struggling to get the embedded player working but you can [play on itch](https://evwgames.itch.io/baby-printer) if you don't want to play the windows or mac builds

WASD to move.

## Assets
All assets were created from scratch other than:
- [Stork & baby bundle image](https://www.rawpixel.com/image/6431215/image-public-domain-pink-purple) - ran out of time to make my own :(
- [Ralphie brown font](https://www.dafont.com/ralphie-brown.font)  - I hope it's okay to use, I spent a lot of time trying to understand font license & acceptable use
